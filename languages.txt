- What is your favorite programming language? Why?

My favorite programming language is Java because I have the most experience in that in regards to school work, my tutoring jobs and summer internship. It makes the most sense to me and I really enjoy using it to program.

- Is your favorite language the one you are also most experienced with? If not, which language are you most experienced with?

Yes Java is the language that is my favorite and the one I have the most experience with. I have a lot of experience with it, almost around 4 years of experience which gives me a good grasp of what kinds of things I can perform with Java and where my knowledge is at.
